# LGS Tray Battery
A tray app used to track battery levels of wireless Logitech mouse.

## Features
### Tray Indicator

Battery percentage and voltage (if supported) in a tray tooltip with notification icon.

Double click for rescan/refresh.

Right-click for more options.

### Http/Web "server" api
By default the running of the http server is disabled, to enable modify `HttpConfig.ini` and change `serverEnable = false` to `serverEnable = true`. Default port number is `12321`, which is configurable if you run into any issues with port numbers.

Send a GET/HTTP request to `localhost:{port}/devices`, for the list of devices currently detected by the program and the corresponding `deviceID`.

With the `deviceID`, a GET/HTTP request to `localhost:{port}/device/{deviceID}`, will result in an xml document of the name and battery status of the device. Devices that do not support `battery_voltage` will report 0.00.

## Known Issues
- Logitech gaming mouses do not natively have a way of reporting battery level, but rather voltage levels. A voltage to percentage lookup table is available for some mouses from Logitech Gaming Software and are included in `PowerModel`. However newer mice have their files embedded within Logitech G Hub and it is not possible to retrieve them without owning said mice. It is possible to dump an `.xml` file within `PowerModel` for support. [Refer to this issue in libratbag.](https://github.com/libratbag/piper/issues/222#issuecomment-487557251)

    - Without the `.xml` file, the tray will display `?` with the tooltip giving `NaN%` with a valid voltage.

    - Using this [automated tool](https://github.com/andyvorld/LGSTrayBattery_GHUB_dump) for automated extraction of `.xml` files. (Working as of 24/02/2021)

- Does not support mice that uses HID++ 1.0 protocols. (Older than 2012?)

- ~~No working refresh/rescan code for connected/disconnect devices. Current work around is to restart the program.~~ Rescan device is done manually within the right-click context menu.

- Currently there are some weird interactions with mouses that can be wired or wireless (e.g. G403) when running in wired mode.

- For unifying receiver devices, currently the program only polls the first device.

## Working with
- G403 Wireless
- MX Anywhere 2S
### Community Tested
- G604 Lightspeed Wireless
- MX Vertical
- G703 Lightspeed Wireless
